This is an ongoing project focused on the visualization of dynamic proximity graphs. 
## grabriel_graph.py
This program generates an animation of the Gabriel Graph where we continuously zoom in while randomly adding and connecting new points.
## relative_neighborhood_graph.py
This program generates an animation of a relative neighborhood graph where we continuously zoom in while randomly adding and connecting new points.
